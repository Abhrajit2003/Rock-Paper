This is a simple Stone Paper Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to compete against the computer in a classic game of chance.

The game follows the standard rules: Stone crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers stone. Players make their selection, and the computer randomly chooses its move. The winner is determined based on the chosen moves.

The first player to score 5 points wins the game! Keep track of your score and aim for victory against the computer.
